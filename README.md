■ Sports Events Made Easy
■ About the Project
Our mission is to simplify the organization of sports events for everyone.
We developed a Sports Management System that helps users create, manage, and track sports
events while handling essential tasks like:
- Event creation
- Player/team registration
- Invitations
- Rewards distribution
With this system, anyone can organize a sports event — from small football tournaments to large
city marathons — without facing the typical hardships of event management.
